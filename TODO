- Reduce memory footprint
- support gene list as input
- add an option to only index exonic sequences (and splice sites) instead of the whole genomic sequence
- Support multi-sample analysis
- support multi-sample VCF
- Connect to Ensembl REST API for annotation
- and RNA mode to index transcript sequence and not genomic sequence
- add an option to request larger sequence than the one specified in the bed file to avoid
  problem with amplicon sequenceing
- retrieve variants from ensembl to create the alternate k-mers with known variants instead
  of all possible variants...
- Find a way to automatically set the -F -C -m parameters from the experimental data
  we could use the mutated k-mers histogram and find a ways to optimize these parameters given
  the mutation rate we could expect (ie: mut_rate < 0.01% ).
